1. Not Remembering to Use remember Properly

3. Optimizing recompositions by hoisting state, using remember, and avoiding unnecessary recompositions are essential practices.

4. State and MutableState are often confused, especially by beginners. State is read-only, while MutableState allows for changes that trigger recompositions

5. LaunchedEffect is a powerful tool in Jetpack Compose that allows you to execute suspend functions and other side effects in response to changes in your composable's lifecycle or state.

Consider Using DisposableEffect for Cleanup: If you need to perform cleanup when the composable is removed from the composition, DisposableEffect is a better choice than LaunchedEffect.


6.Aim to keep your composables as stateless as possible and use remember for caching values that shouldnâ€™t change across recompositions.

8. Not Using Themes and Styling Effectively

@Composable
fun MyComposable() {
    Text(
        "Hello, World!",
        style = MaterialTheme.typography.h6,
        color = MaterialTheme.colors.primary
    )
}

10. Neglecting Accessibility

@Composable
fun AccessibleImage() {
    Image(
        painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.my_image),
        contentDescription = "Description of the image"
    )
}
